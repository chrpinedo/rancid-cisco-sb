## Introduction

I like using [RANCID](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid) to manage a backup of all
the network devices of a network: switches, routers, firewalls,... However,
RANCID lacks of "official" support for Cisco SG300 series switches. These
switches form part of [Cisco's Small Business
serie](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/small-business-300-series-managed-switches/index.html)
and although they are not based on Cisco IOS, they are provided with a CLI with
some similar commands to Cisco IOS's ones.

By Googling I found how to [backup a Cisco SRW2008P switch with
RANCID](http://www.mork.no/~bjorn/srw2008/). I have modified those files to
support not only a SRW switch but also a SG300 switch.

These files add support to RANCID in order to backup Cisco Small Business
switches that comes with an tenel/SSH CLI:
- SRW series switches
- SG series switches
- SFE series switches

Caution! Not all switch models of the previous series comes with an telnet/SSH
CLI and so they cannot be backed up with RANCID (see [Issue #12](http://github.com/chrpinedo/rancid-cisco-sb/issues/12)).

## Installation

### For RANCID 2.x

- Download src/csblogin and src/csbrancid files and put them in the RANCID's PATH (in my case, /opt/rancid/bin).
  - Give them execution permissions (a+rx).
  - Verify that [shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) are pointing to correct perl and expect executables.
- Edit rancid-fe file located in the RANCID's PATH (in my case, /opt/rancid/bin/rancid-fe) and insert a new item in the %vendortable dictionary:

```
'cisco-sb'        => 'csbrancid',
```

### For RANCID 3.x

- Download src/csblogin and src/csbrancid files and put them in the RANCID's PATH (in my case, /opt/rancid/bin).
  - Give them execution permissions (a+rx).
  - Verify that [shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) are pointing to correct perl and expect executables.
- In the configuration directory of RANCID (in my case, /opt/rancid/etc), add the following lines to the rancid.types.conf file (create it if necessary):

```
cisco-sb;script;csbrancid
cisco-sb;login;csblogin
```

## Usage

- Insert the device to backup in the router.db file:

```
test.example.com:cisco-sb:up:
```

- Modify your .cloginrc file:

``` 
add user test.example.com	    {user}
add password test.example.com	    {password}
add autoenable test.example.com	    1
add method test.example.com	    ssh
#add method test.example.com	    ssh:2222	# SSH port TCP/2222
#add method test.example.com	    telnet	# For telnet default TCP port
#add method test.example.com	    telnet:2323	# For telnet port TCP/2323
add userprompt test.example.com	    {"User Name:"}
```

- Enjoy it!
